				 * do while loop   -->> means do something then start loop 
				 * now let me explain how its working and main difference between while loop and do while loop 
				 * 
				 * Do while loop
				 * basically it saying before statring looping execute the statement first 
				 * for example 
				 * before statring looping execute the title of the page first then 
				 * immediately statement coming first at least once statement will execute 
				 * then it will check the condition 
				 * start -> statmenet -> condition check -> end 
				 * 
				 * 
				 * while loop
				 * in while loop first condition check if condition check pass it will loop if not then end the loop 
				 * start -> condition check -> statement -> end 
				 *
